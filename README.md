# Template For Shell

It is a very simple script that helps you to create a shell file and add a start template to the script. It is mostly for learning purpose. I have tried to use the best practices while making it. Please feel free to give suggestions.

## Usage

```shell
template myshell
```

This will create a file `myshell.sh` in your current working directory. If this file exists in the current working directory it will ask for a confirmation for overwriting it.

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- 

```shell

``` -->
